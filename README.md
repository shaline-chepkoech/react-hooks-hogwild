## Project Description
When the app first loads, display a tile for each hog in the porker_data.js file. In the tile, display the name and image for each hog.
When the user clicks on the hog tile, display the other details about the hog (its specialty, weight, greased, and highest medal achieved)
Allow the user to filter the hogs that are greased
Allow the user to sort the hogs based on name or weight

 Allow users to hide hogs (not delete them, just hide them from view!)

 Add a form to allow users to add new hogs to the page
